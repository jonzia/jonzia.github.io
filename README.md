## Bio

I am a neurology resident at Stanford University. I graduated from Emory University School of Medicine (M.D.) in 2022 and earned my Ph.D. in Electrical and Computer Engineering from Georgia Tech in 2020. Previously, I graduated from Arizona State University in 2016 with a BSE in Electrical Engineering. I am interested in medical applications of electrical engineering and computer science.
